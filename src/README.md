Before build, you need to install all available workloads by running batch command below. Note that you need to have WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or `tail` command installed.

```bat
cd "path\to\project"

.\install-dotnet-workloads.bat
dotnet restore
```

> It will take dozens of GB of your local storage.
